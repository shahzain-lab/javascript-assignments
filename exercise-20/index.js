// assignment no.20 - Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// my beautiful lists 
const places = ['Taj Mahal', 'Honda Civic', 'Daman-e-Koh', 'rolls roys'];

// alphabetic printing
places.sort(place => console.log(`${place[0]} for ${place}`));
