// assignment no.13 - Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

// my vehicles
const vehicles = ['Honda Bike', 'Honda Civic', 'range rover', 'rolls roys'];

// my list 
console.log(`${vehicles[0]} aims to stay long with you.`)
console.log(`The newly designed front seats of ${vehicles[1]} are more comfortable than before.`)
console.log(`${vehicles[2]} will continue to be the world's must-have luxury SUV.`)
